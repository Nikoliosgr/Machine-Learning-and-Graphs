# Machine-Learning-and-Graphs
This repository contains two machine-learning projects completed as part of the MYE-002 Machine Learning course. The exercises explore fundamental ML techniques, including supervised classification, dimensionality reduction, and neural network–based autoencoding.

This notebook explores several fundamental machine-learning algorithms using scikit-learn and basic tensor operations in PyTorch.
Techniques Used:
  -Decision Tree Classifier
  -Random Forest Classifier
  -K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  -Data preprocessing with NumPy
  -Conversion of data to PyTorch tensors and usage
Learning Objectives:
  ->Compare the performance of classical ML algorithms
  ->Understand how tensor shapes affect model training
  ->Practice training and evaluating multiple classifiers

File: MachineLearning2.ipynb
This project focuses on compressing high-dimensional data using PCA and a custom-built neural-network autoencoder.
Techniques Used:
  -Standardization (StandardScaler)
  -Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  -Variance-retaining dimensionality reduction
  -Reshaping and preprocessing for PyTorch
  -Designing and training an Autoencoder (encoder + decoder)
Learning Objectives:
  ->Understand how PCA reduces dimensionality
  ->Implement and train an autoencoder from scratch
  ->Compare linear vs. non-linear compression methods
